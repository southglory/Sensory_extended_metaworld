# Sensory_extended_metaworld
This project was forked from original metaworld repository. [Metaworld](https://github.com/rlworkgroup/metaworld) is an open-source simulated benchmark for meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning consisting of 50 distinct robotic manipulation tasks. We added some functions for sensory input to  metaworld.
